#  Epileapsy Seizure Detection

A machine learning-based project designed to detect epileptic seizures using EEG data.  
The dataset contains readings from **500 subjects**, recorded **every second for 23 seconds**, resulting in **11,500 EEG signal readings**.  
The model uses a **binary classification approach** (Seizure / No Seizure).

##  Overview

This project predicts whether a seizure is occurring based on EEG signal patterns.

The process includes:

1. Loading and preprocessing EEG dataset  
2. Normalizing the signal values for uniform scaling  
3. Training a binary classifier using machine learning  
4. Predicting seizure / non-seizure activity on new data
